          Your data and other personal information.</p>

          without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that 
          information from Our servers.</p>
        <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your 
          information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may 
          require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.</p>

        <p>We strongly advise You to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies
          of any third-party web sites or services that You visit.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice

          breach these Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the

          exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount 
          actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't 
          purchased anything through the Service.</p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the 
          Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or 
          consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages 
          for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business 
          interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way 
          related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software 
          and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in 
          connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any 
          supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the 
          remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
        <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of 
          liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of 
          the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will
          be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>

        <h2>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all 
          faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent 
          permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on 
          behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service 
          providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, 
          statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied 
          warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-
          infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course 
          of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing,
          the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no 
          representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, 
          achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other
          software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, 
          meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any 
          errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
        <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the 
          company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, 
          express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or 
          the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) 
          that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, 
          reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the 
          Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from
          or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, 
          worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties 
          or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of 
          the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a 
          case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied 
          to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>

          remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
        <h3>Waiver</h3>
        <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require 
          performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not effect a party's 
          ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time 
          thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any 
          subsequent breach.</p>
