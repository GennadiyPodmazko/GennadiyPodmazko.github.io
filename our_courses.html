        </div>
        <p >The PM's primary duty and responsibility is to bring the customer's idea to realization within the stipulated timeframe using existing resources. The main task of a business analyst is to identify the customer's business problems and find the most effective solution.</p>

        <p>Professionals with skills in both of these professions are invaluable in the labor market. Combining the roles of PM and BA is a practical and reasonable move not only in terms of the project budget or the ratio of time/resources spent on finding one specialist instead of two, but also a very successful concentration of the vision of all the details and the most complete picture of the project in one hand.</p>
          
        <p>On the course you will get: key tools to manage a project of any complexity, experience in requirements gathering and specification, learn effective approaches to estimating tasks and projects.</p>
          
        <p>Training takes place on real projects in our company. A lot of practice and the tremendous experience of our teachers will help you quickly master your dream profession.</p>
          
        <p>Advantages of the profession: high demand in the market, decent pay with clear prospects and an almost endless path of development.

          the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no
